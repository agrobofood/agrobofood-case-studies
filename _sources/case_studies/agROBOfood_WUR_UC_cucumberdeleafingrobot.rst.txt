IIE5 – Cucumber deleafing robot
==================================


Use case description
---------------------
This experiment developed a new mobile robot capable of removing cucumber leaves without damaging the plant stem. The business case was benchmarked against manual labour and found to be positive. Optimising growing method for robot labour instead of human labour would give extra benefit. 

Bringing economically viable robotic harvesting and crop handling technology for greenhouses onto the market, to relieve human labour under harsh and repetitive conditions, to relieve the grower of a declining human labour market and to provide consumers a sustainable solution for future food security. It is the goal to harvest fruit and vegetables automatically, on time and with less manpower resulting in lower production and resource costs whilst solving the labour quality and availability problem. 


Approach
---------
In order to reach the long term goal of greenhouse robotics, a demonstrator is built which can harvest leaves in a greenhouse for the use-case of cucumber and tomato, which requires a market exploration and technological feasibility study to be performed. This project will be a use-case to show that the AGROBOFOOD Digital Innovation Hub can be used to gain valuable customer and technology validation. 



Standardization needs or Lessons learned 
-----------------------------------------
The following bottlenecks or concerns in service provision were identified from the DIH perspective [Source: 20210325-agROBOfood-Cross-border service request observations v2.docx]: 

*The main challenge during the project was to align the timelines between the projectpartners. Especially due to the short period of time available to finish the innovation experiment made it challenging. Bogaerts Greenhouse Logistics wasn’t able to provide Saia with a platform in time to assemble the prototype in order to run the greenhouse experiments according to plan. 
*Bogaerts has worked on a concept design of a mobile platform for robots on a pipe rail system, market research into a SLAM module for autonomous navigation and developed a new communication platform for autonomous vehicles. Despite all efforts, BBA is withdrawing from agROBOfood because not enough time is available to give sufficient attention and added value to the innovation experiment. 
*In the end Saia solved this problem and replaced the Bogaerts platform with an alternative platform. The DIH and agROBOfood projectmanagement was very helpful to make the required projectchanges. Saia was able to adopt and finished to project within the original time frame. 
*Saia was mainly effected by the Covid-19 pandemic in terms of delays caused by obliged working from home. Since all conferences, exhibitions etc. have been canceled the dissemination possibilities were limited to online channels only. 
*How to test cross-border service provision? Budgetary issues can adversely affect the current approach. 
*Who else has experience with cross border service requests? Did they use the agROBOfood mechanism? Can we learn from that? 
*There seems to be too little coordination between the different WPs involved in the provision of services, so that a service request gets stuck.  
*Who is responsible to evaluate the service requests? For example, is the service request rejected by DTI discussed? If it is a budget issue, it is an artefact and should be reported as such. 
*Is the service provision budget still free to use? Did partners already spend the budget or is it allocated for other services? 
*It takes too long before a service request is answered. Couple of weeks or as in this case more than 2 months is too long.  
*Service Catalogue is not easily searchable. 
*Are the ‘basic’ guidelines still applicable? Where to find the discussed modifications of January 2021?
